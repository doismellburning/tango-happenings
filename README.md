django-happenings
=================

My calendar app. I make no promises it will work for you, but if you try it, let me know.

Supports multi-day events, schedules, photos, updates, recaps and a bunch of other stuff that nobody but me will probably ever need or want.

Includes a copy of jquery.hcal for easy calendar creation.

To-do:
  Templates are a complete mess.
